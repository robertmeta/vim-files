==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*traces-introduction*

This plugin will highlight |pattern| and |:range| for Ex-commands.

Ranges which are composed of only absolute specifiers ({number}, ., $, %) will
not be highlighted until the command that support them is specified. 
There are many commands which use ranges other than lines in buffer and it
would be distracting to highlight selections for them. To force immediate
feedback for ranges composed of only absolute specifiers enter and delete '//'
or some other pattern or mark specifier.

Ranges which are composed of at least one pattern or mark specifier will be
highlighted immediately.

Patterns for the following commands will be highlighted immediatelly as typed:

  |:substitute|
  |:smagic|
  |:snomagic|
  |:global|
  |:vglobal|

Live preview is implemented for the following commands:

  |:substitute|
  |:smagic|
  |:snomagic|

==============================================================================
