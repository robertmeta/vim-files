Section 1: Introduction                    *mucomplete-introduction*

MUcomplete (or µcomplete) is a minimalist autocompletion plugin.

MUcomplete does nothing more than typing some completion mappings
for you, either when you press <tab>/<s-tab> or automatically while
you are typing. You choose which completion methods to use and in
which order, and µcomplete does the rest. It does no caching, no
asynchronous computation, no intelligent guessing. It just makes use
of built-in Vim features.

====================================================================
Section 2: Requirements                    *mucomplete-requirements*

MUcomplete requires Vim 7.2 compiled with |+insert_expand| and
|+menu|. Automatic completion is available in Vim 7.4.775 or later
(Vim 7.4.784 or later recommended).
MUcomplete is developed and tested on Vim 8.

====================================================================
Section 3: Getting started                        *mucomplete-howto*

Mandatory Vim settings:
>
  set completeopt+=menuone
<
Other recommended settings:
>
  set shortmess+=c
<
For automatic completion, you most likely want one of these:
>
  set completeopt+=noinsert
  set completeopt+=noinsert,noselect
<
Press <tab> in Insert mode to complete a word. This will
sequentially trigger the methods specified in |g:mucomplete#chains|,
until some results are found. You may use <s-tab> to try the same
list of methods in reverse order. For example, if the current
completion chain is `['omni', 'keyn']` (see |mucomplete-methods|),
then pressing <tab> will cause omni completion to be attempted first
(provided that |'omnifunc'| is defined). If |'omnifunc'| is not
defined or the omni completion function returns no results, then
µcomplete will fallback to local keyword completion (`'keyn'`).
Pressing <s-tab> will trigger keyword completion first, and fallback
to omni completion if necessary. You may define arbitrarily long
completion chains, and even filetype-specific or buffer-specific
completion chains.

Sometimes, the first method returning results is not the one you
want. With the pop-up menu visible, you may type <c-h> and <c-j> to
cycle back and forth, respectively, through the current completion
chain.

If you want completion to be triggered automatically, set
|g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup|.

Note: completion is disabled when |'paste'| is on.

In detail, this is the algorithm used by µcomplete:

1. Retrieve the current completion chain from |b:mucomplete_chain|,
   if defined, otherwise from |g:mucomplete#chains|.

2. For each method listed in the given completion chain:

   2(a). Check whether the method can be applied by invoking the
         corresponding function in |g:mucomplete#can_complete|.

   2(b). If the method can be applied, invoke the corresponding
         mapping and go to 2(c); otherwise, try the next method.

   2(c). If some results are returned, show them in a pop-up menu
         and stop; otherwise, try the next method.

====================================================================
Section 4: Completion methods                   *mucomplete-methods*

MUcomplete supports all the completion methods described in
|ins-completion| (not all of them are enabled by default, see
|g:mucomplete#chains|). Each method is defined by a string:

`'c-n'` : keywords in |'complete'| (search forwards);
`'c-p'` : keywords in |'complete'| (search backwards);
`'cmd'` : Vim command line;
`'defs'`: definitions or macros;
`'dict'`: keywords in |'dictionary'|;
`'file'`: file names;
`'incl'`: keywords in the current and included files;
`'keyn'`: keywords in the current file (search forwards);
`'keyp'`: keywords in the current file (search backwards);
`'line'`: whole lines;
`'omni'`: omni completion (|'omnifunc'|);
`'spel'`: spelling suggestions;
`'tags'`: tags;
`'thes'`: keywords in |'thesaurus'|;
`'user'`: user defined completion (|'completefunc'|).

Besides, µcomplete implements its own alternative file completion
and spelling suggestions:

`'path'`: file names (µcomplete's implementation).
`'uspl'`: spelling suggestions (µcomplete's implementation).

If you have installed UltiSnips, there is also a method to get
suggestions for snippets (if you use SnipMate, see
|mucomplete-tips|):

`'ulti'`: UltiSnips snippets.

Additional completion methods may be defined with
|g:mucomplete#user_mappings|.

====================================================================
Section 5: Path completion                *mucomplete-path-complete*

MUcomplete's default completion chain includes the `'file'`
completion method, which is based on Vim's built-in file completion
(see |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-F|). The `'file'` method works exactly as
|i_CTRL-X_CTRL_F|, with one exception: if you have enabled automatic
completion, pressing CTRL-Y to accept a path automatically triggers
the completion menu for the next portion of the path. Some people
like ZSH behaviour, whereby typing a slash enters the current
directory. This can be easily achieved by defining the following
mapping in your |vimrc|:
>
  function! IsBehindDir()
    return strpart(getline('.'), 0, col('.') - 1)  =~# '\f\+/$'
  endfunction
  inoremap <expr> / pumvisible() && IsBehindDir() ? "\<c-y>" : '/'
<
A limitation of the `'file'` method is that it does not expand paths
containing spaces (in principle, one could add a space to
|'isfname'|, but that is not recommended: see |'isfname'| for the
details).

MUcomplete also implements its own path completion method, called
`'path'`. This differs from `'file'` because no slash is appended
when completing a path, and paths with spaces are expanded
correctly. Apart from the fact the spaces are dealt with, the
`'path'` method still uses |'isfname'| to decide which characters
define path names. Both methods complete relative paths, too
(relative to the current working directory).

Note: `'path'` completion requires Vim 7.3.465 or later.

If you use one of the methods above, you may want to adjust the
value of |g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern| to trigger
autocompletion after typing a slash. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern = \
    \ { 'default': '\k\k$\|/$'' }
<
All of the above holds for Windows users by replacing slashes with
backslashes.

====================================================================
Section 6: Spelling suggestions           *mucomplete-spel-complete*

The `'spel'` method invokes |i_CTRL-X_s| to perform the completion.
Such mapping causes Vim to search for a badly spelled word in the
current line anywhere before the cursor. This is especially puzzling
when automatic completion is on, because Vim's behaviour may make
the cursor jump to a previous, possibly distant, column.

For this reason, µcomplete implements an alternative completion
method, called `'uspl'`. This still uses Vim's built-in spelling
features (see |spellbadword()| and |spellsuggest()|), but only the
word immediately before the cursor is considered. It also has
a couple of options (see |mucomplete-customization|). This is the
recommended spelling method to use, especially if you enable
automatic completion.

====================================================================
Section 7: Commands                            *mucomplete-commands*

`:MUcompleteAutoOn`
  Enable automatic completion.

`:MUcompleteAutoOff`
  Disable automatic completion.

`:MUcompleteAutoToggle`
  Toggle automatic completion.

====================================================================
Section 8: Mappings                            *mucomplete-mappings*

The following mappings are enabled by default. If you do not want
that, see |g:mucomplete#no_mappings|.

<tab>
  Trigger forward chained completion. When the pop-up menu is
  visible, select the next menu entry or try the next completion
  method depending on the value of
  |g:mucomplete#cycle_with_trigger|.

<s-tab>
  Trigger backward chained completion. When the pop-up menu is
  visible, select the previous menu entry or try the previous
  completion method depending on the value of
  |g:mucomplete#cycle_with_trigger|.

<c-j>
  When the pop-up menu is visible, try the next completion method
  that can be applied.

<c-h>
  When the pop-up menu is visible, try the previous completion
  method that can be applied.

In your |vimrc|, you may override such mappings. For example, to
use <c-j> and <c-k> instead of <tab> and <s-tab>, use:
>
  imap <c-j> <plug>(MUcompleteFwd)
  imap <c-k> <plug>(MUcompleteBwd)
<
To use, say, <left> and <right> as cycling keys, use the following:
>
  inoremap <silent> <plug>(MUcompleteFwdKey) <right>
  imap <right> <plug>(MUcompleteCycFwd)
  inoremap <silent> <plug>(MUcompleteBwdKey) <left>
  imap <left> <plug>(MUcompleteCycBwd)
<
Note: if you decide to use your own cycling keys, please be aware
that the keys that are valid in CTRL-X mode are not mapped (see
|ins-completion|). This means, for example, that if you map `<c-k>`
as a cycling key, such mapping will be shadowed when the pop-up menu
is offering dictionary suggestions, because CTRL-K is already used
by Vim during dictionary completion to search for the next matching
keyword (see |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|).

====================================================================
Section 8: Customization                  *mucomplete-customization*

                                       *'g:mucomplete#can_complete'*
A Dictionary defining the conditions to be verified for a given
method to be applied. Each condition is a |lambda|, |function()| or
|funcref()| with one argument (the text to be completed), which
returns either 1 or 0, according to whether the corresponding method
can be applied or not.
>
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete = {
      \   'default' : {
      \       'dict':  { t -> strlen(&l:dictionary) > 0 },
      \       'file':  { t -> t =~# '\m\%(/\|\~\)\f*$' },
      \       'omni':  { t -> strlen(&l:omnifunc) > 0 },
      \       'spel':  { t -> &l:spell && !empty(&l:spelllang) },
      \       'tags':  { t -> !empty(tagfiles()) },
      \       'thes':  { t -> strlen(&l:thesaurus) > 0 },
      \       'user':  { t -> strlen(&l:completefunc) > 0 },
      \       'path':  { t -> t =~# '\m\%(/\|\~\)\f*$' },
      \       'ulti':  { t -> get(g:, 'did_plugin_ultisnips', 0) },
      \       'uspl':  { t -> &l:spell && !empty(&l:spelllang) }
      \   }
      \ }
<
If no key is found in |g:mucomplete#can_complete| for the current
method, such method is tried unconditionally.

In your |vimrc|, you may override some or all the default
conditions or add filetype-specific conditions. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete = {}
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete.default = {
      \ 'uspl' : { t -> &l:spell && &l:spelllang == 'en' }
      \ }
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete.cpp = {
      \ 'omni': { t -> t =~# '::$' }
      \ }
<
This will perform a custom check for `'uspl'` completion, and
a custom check for `'omni'` completion in cpp buffers. In all other
cases, the default conditions will be checked.

                                             *'b:mucomplete_chain'*
A List specifying a completion chain for the current buffer only.
When this variable is defined, the value of |g:mucomplete#chains| is
ignored.

                                             *'g:mucomplete#chains'*
A Dictionary defining the Lists of completion chains.
>
  let g:mucomplete#chains = {
      \ 'default' : ['file', 'omni', 'keyn', 'dict'],
      \ 'vim'     : ['file', 'cmd', 'keyn']
      \ }
<
In your |vimrc|, you may override the defaults or add
filetype-specific completion chains. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#chains = { 'default': ['omni', 'c-p'] }
  let g:mucomplete#chains.markdown = ['keyn', 'dict', 'uspl']
<
                                     *'g:mucomplete#ctrlx_mode_out'*
The key combo to exit CTRL-X sub-mode. You should never need to
change this value, unless you have mapped <c-g><c-g> in Insert mode.
>
  let g:mucomplete#ctrlx_mode_out = "\<c-g>\<c-g>"
<
Choose the value of this variable very carefully: a wrong setting
will break µcomplete! In general, the mapping should behave as
follows:

1. if Vim is in CTRL-X sub-mode, the mapping should cause Vim to
   exit CTRL-X sub-mode without inserting any text;
2. if Vim is not in CTRL-X sub-mode, the mapping should do nothing.

If you don't know what CTRL-X sub-mode is or you don't understand
why the default value is defined that way, that's a hint that you
should not try and change this variable :) Anyway, see |i_CTRL-X|
for the details.

The following are alternative choices that may (or may not) work
depending on your mappings and your plugins:
>
  let g:mucomplete#ctrlx_mode_out = "\<c-x>\<c-b>\<bs>"
  let g:mucomplete#ctrlx_mode_out = "\<c-x>\<c-g>\<bs>"
  let g:mucomplete#ctrlx_mode_out = "\<c-x>\<c-z>\<bs>"
<
                                 *'g:mucomplete#cycle_with_trigger'*
Set to 1 to use <s-tab> and <tab> (or whatever your manual
completion triggers are) to move back and forth, respectively,
through the current completion chain when the pop-up menu is
visible.
>
  let g:mucomplete#cycle_with_trigger = 0
<
Note: if you set this to 1, you have to use the standard CTRL-N and
CTRL-P to select the entries in the pop-up menu.

                             *'g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup'*
Set to 1 to enable automatic completion at startup.
>
  let g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup = 0
<
                                        *'g:mucomplete#no_mappings'*
Set to 1 to prevent µcomplete to define any mapping.
>
  let g:mucomplete#no_mappings = 0
<
                                    *'g:mucomplete#spel#good_words'*
Set to 1 if you want spelling suggestions (similar words) even for
words that are spelled correctly. By default, no suggestions are
returned for good words by the `'uspl'` method.
>
  let g:mucomplete#spel#good_words = 0
<
Note: this setting does not affect the `'spel'` method.

                                           *'g:mucomplete#spel#max'*
The maximum number of spelling suggestions offered by the `'uspl'`
method.
>
  let g:mucomplete#spel#max = 25
<
Note: this setting does not affect the `'spel'` method.

                               *'g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern'*
A Dictionary of patterns to decide when automatic completion should
be fired. Only relevant when automatic completion is on (see
|:MUcompleteAutoOn| and |g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup|).
By default, automatic completion is triggered when there are two
keyword characters in front of the cursor:
>
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern = { 'default' : '\k\k$' }
<
In your |vimrc|, you may override the default pattern or add
filetype-specific patterns. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern = {}
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern.default = '\a\a\a$'
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern.cpp     = '\k\k$'
<
This will trigger automatic completion after three alphabetic
characters by default, except for cpp filetypes, where automatic
completion will be triggered after two keyword characters.

                           *'g:mucomplete#ultisnips#match_at_start'*
By default, the `'ulti'` method returns the snippets whose name
starts with the word in front of the cursor. Set this to 0 to return
all the snippets that contain the word in front of the cursor.
>
  let g:mucomplete#ultisnips#match_at_start = 1
<
                                      *'g:mucomplete#user_mappings'*
A Dictionary of user-defined completion methods. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#user_mappings = {
      \ 'sqla' : "\<c-c>a",
      \ 'xyz'  : "\<c-r>=MyCustomComplete()\<cr>"
      \ }
<
Each key in the dictionary is an arbitrary string providing the name
of the completion method (but you cannot override the predefined
names) and the corresponding value is the mapping that triggers the
desired completion.

User-defined completion methods may be used as predefined methods.
For instance:
>
  let g:mucomplete#chains = {}
  let g:mucomplete#chains.default = ['keyp', 'xyz']
  let g:mucomplete#chains.sql = ['sqla', 'keyp', 'tags']
<
                                           *'g:mucomplete_with_key'*
Read-only flag that tells whether completion was initiated manually
by the user or it was triggered automatically. See |mucomplete-tips|
for an example. Note: do not set the value of this variable!

====================================================================
Section 10: Tips & tricks                          *mucomplete-tips*

Use different values of completeopt ~
If you want to use different values of |'completeopt'| for manual
and automatic completion, you may adapt the following snippet:
>
  fun! s:toggle_completeopt()
    if exists('#MUcompleteAuto')
      set completeopt+=noinsert,noselect
    else
      set completeopt-=noinsert,noselect
    endif
  endf
  command! MUcompleteAutoToggle call mucomplete#toggle_auto()
        \  | call <sid>toggle_completeopt()
  command! MUcompleteAutoOn     call mucomplete#enable_auto()
        \  | call <sid>toggle_completeopt()
  command! MUcompleteAutoOff    call mucomplete#disable_auto()
        \  | call <sid>toggle_completeopt()
<
Put the code above in your |vimrc|. Please keep in mind that
`noinsert` and `noselect` are ignored in manual completion, except
for spelling suggestions (`'spel'` and `'uspl'` methods).

Enable a completion method only when typing <tab> ~
Some completion methods are inherently slow, and it doesn't make
much sense to trigger them automatically, because they would be
called too frequently. Yet, you might want to trigger them manually
by pressing <tab> (or whatever your manual completion trigger is).
This can be achieved by testing the value of |g:mucomplete_with_key|
in a custom check.

For instance, suppose that you have automatic completion on and you
want to use thesaurus completion. Searching for synonyms after each
key press would be too slow (beside being pointless). To work around
this problem, in your |vimrc| you may define:
>
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete = {}
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete.default = {
    \ 'thes': {
    \         t -> g:mucomplete_with_key && strlen(&l:thesaurus) > 0
    \         }
    \ }
  # Add 'thes' to your completion chains, e.g.:
  let g:mucomplete#chains = { 'default': ['keyn', 'thes'] }
<
Then, searching for synonyms will happen only when you press <tab>
or <s-tab> (and keyword completion returns no results); during
normal typing, only keyword completion will be active.

Optimize your completion chains ~
The `'c-n'`, `'c-p'` and `'line'` methods allow you to aggregate
completion suggestions from several sources (see |'complete'|),
including dictionaries and tags. While this is handy, it may have
a couple of drawbacks: first, you may get too many suggestions,
making completion less useful; second, you may incur an efficiency
penalty, especially if you have big tag files or dictionaries or
many included files. This may slows you down noticeably, in
particular when automatic completion is on.

You may optimize your workflow by using longer completion chains and
reducing the options in |'complete'| accordingly. For example,
instead of:
>
  let g:mucomplete#chains = { 'default' : ['c-p'] }
<
you might use:
>
  set complete-=i
  set complete-=t
  let g:mucomplete#chains = { 'default' : ['c-p', 'incl', 'tags'] }
<
so that searching included files and/or tags will happen only when
completion cannot be performed otherwise.

====================================================================
Section 11: Compatibility                 *mucomplete-compatibility*

MUcomplete tries to be a responsible citizen in Vimland. This
section describes how to make it peacefully coexist with other
plugins.

PHP + UltiSnips ~
In some versions of Vim, there is a known compatibility issue
between PHP's |'omnifunc'| function and UltiSnips. This bug is hit
by µcomplete when

- automatic completion is on;
- the `'omni'` method is in your completion chain;
- you try to move between the different parts of a snippet while
  expanding a snippet (and you discover that you can't).

There are two workarounds if you still want to use UltiSnips with
PHP:

- remove `'omni'` from PHP's completion chain;
- disable automatic completion (and do not trigger completion during
  snippet expansion).

Note: this is not a bug in µcomplete.

SnipMate ~
In your |vimrc|, set:
>
  let g:snipMate['no_match_completion_feedkeys_chars'] = ''
<
Then, define a custom completion method:
>
  let g:mucomplete#user_mappings = {
      \ 'snip' : "\<plug>snipMateShow"
      \ }
<
and add it to your completion chain(s). For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#chains = { 'default': ['snip', 'keyn'] }
<
You may also find it convenient to define SnipMate's trigger as
follows:
>
  imap <expr> <c-j> (pumvisible() ? "\<c-y>" : "")
    \               . "\<plug>snipMateNextOrTrigger"
<
so you can expand a snippet while the pop-up menu is still visible.
If you want to use <tab> to expand snippets, you have to either
disable µcomplete's mappings (see |g:mucomplete#no_mappings|) or map
µcomplete's manual completion trigger to something else (see
|mucomplete-mappings|).

vim-peekabo ~
By default, vim-peekabo remaps <c-r> in Insert mode. Since µcomplete
relies on |i_CTRL-R| in an essential way, you have to change
vim-peekabo's mapping:
>
  let g:peekaboo_ins_prefix = '<c-x>'
<
Note: now you need to press <c-x><c-r> to view the registers.

====================================================================
Section 12: Troubleshooting             *mucomplete-troubleshooting*

Before reporting a bug, please do the following:

1. Use the following `vimrc_mucomplete` to rule out conflicts with
   other plugins: >

     set runtimepath+=/path/to/mucomplete/
     set completeopt=menuone,noinsert
     set showmode shortmess-=c
<
   Add other µcomplete options as you see fit. Run with: >

     vim -N -u vimrc_mucomplete
<
   Can you still reproduce your problem? If not, a conflict with
   another plugin or a setting in your |vimrc| may be the culprit.

2. Double-check your completion chains: >

     echo g:mucomplete#chains
<
   Also, check whether |b:mucomplete_chain| is defined, because its
   value shadows the global dictionary. Are the methods you expect
   to be used defined and in the correct order?

3. Some completion methods are enabled conditionally. For example,
   dictionary completion may be triggered only if |'dictionary'| is
   set in the current buffer. If you have trouble with
   a conditionally enabled completion method, please check whether
   the corresponding condition is satisfied (see
   |g:mucomplete#can_complete|).

4. Turn off automatic completion: >

     :MUcompleteAutoOff
<
   and try to complete a word using the corresponding mapping (see
   |ins-completion| for a list of available mappings). For example,
   for omni completion, use |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|. Do you get
   a different output compared to what µcomplete provides? If not,
   then the problem is not µcomplete.

   If triggering completion manually results in the expected
   behaviour, but µcomplete behaves differently, please report the
