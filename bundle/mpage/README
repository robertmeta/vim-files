MPage shows a file in multiple windows, with each sequential window showing sequential lines of text, rather like a book.

Usage:

   :MPage [splits]
  :[splits]MPage

will split a window into "splits" pages.  Subsequently, a 

  :MPage

will turn multi-paging off for all windows holding the current window's buffer (this doesn't "quit" the windows, it merely turns off synchronization).

A

  :MPage!

will turn off multipaging for all windows in the current tab.

:MPT  will toggle the current window's participation in multipaging.
:MPN will go to the next mpage-controlled window        (accepts a count, too)
:MPP will go to the previous mpage-controlled window  (accepts a count, too)

As always with my plugins, the latest version, albeit experimental, is available at my website:
