## Preface
This plugin takes the advantage of new apis in Vim 8 to enable you to run shell commands in background and read output in the quickfix window in realtime:

- Easy to use, just start your background command by `:AsyncRun` (just like old "!" cmd).
- Command is done in the background, no need to wait for the entire process to finish.
- Output are displayed in the quickfix window, errors are matched with `errorformat`.
- You can explore the error output immediately or keep working in vim while executing.
- Ring the bell or play a sound to notify you job finished while you're focusing on editing.
- Fast and lightweight, just a single self-contained `asyncrun.vim` source file.  

If that doesn't excite you, then perhaps this GIF screen capture below will change your mind.

## Install
Copy `asyncrun.vim` to your `~/.vim/plugin` or use Vundle to install it from `skywind3000/asyncrun.vim` .

## Tutorials

#### Async run gcc to compile current file
	:AsyncRun gcc % -o %<
	:AsyncRun g++ -O3 % -o %< -lpthread 
This command will run gcc in the background and output to the quickfix window in realtime. Macro '`%`' stands for filename and '`%>`' represents filename without extension.

#### Async run make
    :AsyncRun make
	:AsyncRun make -f makefile

#### Grep key word 
    :AsyncRun! grep -R word . 
    :AsyncRun! grep -R <cword> . 
when `!` is included, auto-scroll in quickfix will be disabled. `<cword>` represents current word under cursor.

#### Compile go project
    :AsyncRun go build %:p:h
Macro '`%:p:h`' stands for current file dir. 

#### Lookup man page
    :AsyncRun! man -S 3:2:1 <cword>

#### Git push
    :AsyncRun git push origin master

#### Setup `<F7>` to compile file
    :noremap <F7> :AsyncRun gcc % -o %< <cr> 

## Manual

There are two vim commands: `:AsyncRun` and `:AsyncStop` to control async jobs.

#### AsyncRun - Run shell command

```VimL
:AsyncRun{!} [cmd] ...
```

run shell command in background and output to quickfix. when `!` is included, auto-scroll in quickfix will be disabled. Parameters are splited by space, if a parameter contains space, it should be escaped as backslash + space (just like ex commands).

Parameters accept macros start with '`%`', '`#`' or '`<`' :

    %:p     - File name of current buffer with full path
    %:t     - File name of current buffer without path
    %:p:h   - File path of current buffer without file name
    %:e     - File extension of current buffer
    %:t:r   - File name of current buffer without path and extension
    %       - File name relativize to current directory
    %:h:.   - File path relativize to current directory
    <cwd>   - Current directory
    <cword> - Current word under cursor
    <cfile> - Current file name under cursor

Environment variables are set before executing:

    $VIM_FILEPATH  - File name of current buffer with full path
    $VIM_FILENAME  - File name of current buffer without path
    $VIM_FILEDIR   - Full path of current buffer without the file name
    $VIM_FILEEXT   - File extension of current buffer
    $VIM_FILENOEXT - File name of current buffer without path and extension
    $VIM_CWD       - Current directory
    $VIM_RELDIR    - File path relativize to current directory
    $VIM_RELNAME   - File name relativize to current directory 
    $VIM_CWORD     - Current word under cursor
    $VIM_CFILE     - Current filename under cursor
    $VIM_GUI       - Is running under gui ?
    $VIM_VERSION   - Value of v:version
    $VIM_COLUMNS   - How many columns in vim's screen
    $VIM_LINES     - How many lines in vim's screen
	$VIM_SVRNAME   - Value of v:servername for +clientserver usage 

These environment variables wrapped by `$(...)` (eg. `$(VIM_FILENAME)`) will also be expanded in the parameters.

#### AsyncStop - Stop the running job

```VimL
:AsyncStop{!}
```

stop the running job, when "!" is included, job will be stopped by signal KILL

#### Settings:

- g:asyncrun_exit - script will be executed after finished
- g:asyncrun_bell - non-zero to ring a bell after finished
- g:asyncrun_mode - 0:async(require vim 7.4.1829) 1:sync 2:shell

#### Variables:
- g:asyncrun_code - exit code
- g:asyncrun_status - 'running', 'success' or 'failure'

#### Requirements:
vim 7.4.1829 is minimal version to support async mode. If you are use older versions, `g:asyncrun_mode` will fall back from `0/async` to `1/sync`.
