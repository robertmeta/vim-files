====================================================================
Section 1: Introduction                    *mucomplete-introduction*

MUcomplete (or µcomplete) is a minimalist autocompletion plugin.

MUcomplete does nothing more than typing some completion mappings
for you (see |ins-completion|), either when you press <tab>/<s-tab>
or automatically while you are typing. You choose which completion
methods to use and in which order, and µcomplete does the rest. It
does no caching, no asynchronous computation, no intelligent
guessing. It just makes use of built-in Vim features.

====================================================================
Section 2: Requirements                    *mucomplete-requirements*

MUcomplete requires Vim compiled with |+insert_expand| and |+menu|.

MUcomplete has been tested with Vim 8 only.

Note: |<c-b>| should not be mapped in Insert mode (see
|i_ctrl-b-gone| and |g:mucomplete#exit_ctrlx_keys|).

====================================================================
Section 3: Getting started                        *mucomplete-howto*

Recommended Vim settings:

  `set completeopt+=menu,menuone`
  `set shortmess+=c`

Press <tab> in Insert mode to complete a word. This will
sequentially trigger the methods specified in |g:mucomplete#chains|,
until some results are found. You may use <s-tab> to try the same
list of methods in reverse order. For example, if the current
completion chain is ['omni', 'keyn'] (see |mucomplete-methods|),
then pressing <tab> will cause omni completion to be attempted first
(provided that |'omnifunc'| is defined). If |'omnifunc'| is not
defined or the omni completion function returns no results, then
µcomplete will fallback to local keyword completion (|'keyn'|).
Pressing <s-tab> will trigger the same methods in reverse order. You
may define arbitrarily long completion chains, and even
filetype-specific completion chains.

In detail, this is the algorithm used by µcomplete:

1. Retrieve the current completion chain from |g:mucomplete#chains|.

2. For each method listed in the completion chain:

   2(a). Check whether the method can be applied by invoking the
         corresponding function defined for the current filetype in
         |g:mucomplete#can_complete|.

   2(b). If the method can be applied, invoke the corresponding
         mapping.

   2(c). If some results are returned, show them in a pop-up menu
         and stop; otherwise, try the next method.

====================================================================
Section 4: Completion methods                   *mucomplete-methods*

By default, µcomplete provides the completion methods described in
|ins-completion| (not all of them are enabled by default, see
|g:mucomplete#chains|):

|'c-n'| : keywords in |'complete'| (search forwards);
|'c-p'| : keywords in |'complete'| (search backwards);
|'cmd'| : Vim command line;
|'defs'|: definitions or macros;
|'dict'|: keywords in |'dictionary'|;
|'file'|: file names;
|'incl'|: keywords in the current and included files;
|'keyn'|: keywords in the current file (search forwards);
|'keyp'|: keywords in the current file (search backwards);
|'line'|: whole lines;
|'omni'|: omni completion (|'omnifunc'|);
|'spel'|: spelling suggestions;
|'tags'|: tags;
|'thes'|: keywords in |'thesaurus'|;
|'user'|: user defined completion (|'completefunc'|).

If you have installed UltiSnips, there is also a method to get
suggestions for snippets:

|'ulti'|: UltiSnips snippets.

Additional completion methods may be defined with
|g:mucomplete#user_mappings|.

====================================================================
Section 5: Commands                            *mucomplete-commands*

:MUcompleteAutoOn
  Enable automatic completion.

:MUcompleteAutoOff
  Disable automatic completion.

====================================================================
Section 6: Mappings                            *mucomplete-mappings*

The following mappings are enabled by default. If you do not want
that, see |g:mucomplete#no_mappings|.

<tab>
  Trigger forward chained completion.

<s-tab>
  Trigger backward chained completion.

In your |.vimrc|, you may override such mappings. For example, to
use <c-j> and <c-k> instead of <tab> and <s-tab>, use: >
  imap <c-j> <plug>(MUcompleteFwd)
  imap <c-k> <plug>(MUcompleteBwd)
<

====================================================================
Section 7: Customization                  *mucomplete-customization*

                                        *'g:mucomplete#auto_select'*
Set to 1 to have the first entry in the pop-up menu automatically
selected, but not inserted. Only relevant when automatic completion
is on (see |g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup| and
|:MUcompleteAutoOn|).
>
  let g:mucomplete#auto_select = 0
<

                                       *'g:mucomplete#can_complete'*
A Dictionary defining the conditions to be verified for a given
method to be applied. Each condition is a function with one argument
(the text to be completed), which returns either 1 or 0, according
to whether the corresponding method can be applied or not.
>
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete = {
      \   'default' : {
      \       'dict':  { t -> strlen(&l:dictionary) > 0 },
      \       'file':  { t -> t =~# g:mucomplete#pathsep . '\f*$' },
      \       'omni':  { t -> strlen(&l:omnifunc) > 0 },
      \       'spel':  { t -> &l:spell && !empty(&l:spelllang) },
      \       'tags':  { t -> !empty(tagfiles()) },
      \       'thes':  { t -> strlen(&l:thesaurus) > 0 },
      \       'user':  { t -> strlen(&l:completefunc) > 0 },
      \       'ulti':  { t -> get(g:, 'did_plugin_ultisnips', 0) }
      \   }
      \ }
<

If there is no key in |g:mucomplete#can_complete.default| for the
current method, such method will be tried unconditionally.

In your |.vimrc|, you may override some or all the default
conditions or add filetype-specific conditions. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete = {}
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete.default = {
      \ 'spel' : { t -> &l:spell && &l:spelllang == 'en' }
      \ }
  let g:mucomplete#can_complete.cpp = {
      \ 'omni': { t -> t =~# '::$' }
      \ }
<

This will perform a custom check for |'spel'| completion, and
a custom check for |'omni'| completion in cpp buffers. In all other
cases, the default conditions will be checked.

                                             *'b:mucomplete_chain'*
A List specifying a completion chain for the current buffer only.
When this variable is defined, the value of |g:mucomplete#chains| is
ignored.

                                             *'g:mucomplete#chains'*
A Dictionary defining the Lists of completion chains. A completion
chain is provided as a default; besides, filetype-specific
completion chains may be added by the user.
>
  let g:mucomplete_chains = {
      \ 'default' : ['file', 'omni', 'keyn', 'dict']
      \ }
<

In your |.vimrc|, you may override the default completion chain or
add filetype-specific completion chains. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#chains = {}
  let g:mucomplete#chains.default = ['omni', 'c-p']
  let g:mucomplete#chains.markdown = ['keyn', 'spel', 'dict']
<

                             *'g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup'*
Set to 1 to enable automatic completion at startup.
>
  let g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup = 0
<

                                    *'g:mucomplete#exit_ctrlx_keys'*

The key combo to exit ctrl-x submode. You should never need to
change this value, unless you have remapped <c-b> in Insert mode.
>
  let g:mucomplete#exit_ctrlx_keys = "\<c-b>\<bs>"
<

                                        *'g:mucomplete#no_mappings'*
Set to 1 to prevent µcomplete to define any mapping.
>
  let g:mucomplete#no_mappings = 0
<

                                            *'g:mucomplete#pathsep'*
The regular expression defining a path separator.
>
  let g:mucomplete#pathsep = '/'  " '\' on Windows
<

                               *'g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern'*
A Dictionary of patterns to decide when automatic completion should
be fired. Only relevant when automatic completion is on (see
|:MUcompleteAutoOn| and |g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup|).
>
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern = { 'default' : '\k\k$' }
<

In your |.vimrc|, you may override the default pattern or add
filetype-specific patterns. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern = {}
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern.default = '\a\a\a$'
  let g:mucomplete#trigger_auto_pattern.cpp     = '\k\k$'
<
This will trigger automatic completion after three alphabetic
characters by default, except for cpp filetypes, where automatic
completion will be triggered after two keyword characters.

                           *'g:mucomplete#ultisnips#match_at_start'*
By default, the |'ulti'| method returns the snippets whose name
starts with the current word. Set this to 0 to return all the
snippets that contain the current word.
>
  let g:mucomplete#ultisnips#match_at_start = 1
<

                                      *'g:mucomplete#user_mappings'*
User-defined completion methods. For example:
>
  let g:mucomplete#user_mappings = {
      \ 'sqla' : "\<c-c>a"
      \ }
<

User-defined completion methods may be used as predefined methods,
e.g.:
>
  let g:mucomplete#chains = {}
  let g:mucomplete#chains.sql = ['sqla', 'keyp', 'tags']
<

                             *'g:mucomplete#user_mappings_deselect'*
Used to specify, for a user completion method, a non-default key to
switch to state 3 when the pop-up menu becomes visible (see
|ins-completion-menu|). The default key is CTRL-P. This option is
only relevant if automatic completion is on (see |:MUcompleteAutoOn|
and |g:mucomplete#enable_auto_at_startup|).

You do not need to set this variable, unless the completion method
you are using selects by default an entry different from the first
one.
>
  let g:mucomplete#user_mappings_deselect = {
    \ 'c-p' : "\<c-n>",
    \ 'keyp': "\<c-n>"
    \ }
<

====================================================================
Section 8: Troubleshooting              *mucomplete-troubleshooting*

Before reporting a bug, please do the following:

1. Use the following |vimrc_mucomplete| to rule out conflicts with
   other plugins: >
     set runtimepath+=/path/to/mucomplete/
     set completeopt-=longest
     set completeopt+=menu,menuone
     set showmode shortmess-=c
<
   Add other µcomplete options as you see fit. Run with: >
     vim -N -u vimrc_mucomplete
<
   Can you still reproduce your problem? If not, a conflict with
   another plugin or a setting in your |vimrc| may be the culprit.

2. Double-check your completion chain: >
     echo g:mucomplete#chains
<
   Are the methods you expect to be used defined and in the correct
   order?

3. Some completion methods are enabled conditionally. For example,
   dictionary completion may be triggered only if |'dictionary'| is
   set in the current buffer. If you have trouble with
   a conditionally enabled completion method, please check whether
   the corresponding condition is satisfied (see
   |g:mucomplete#can_complete|).

4. Turn off automatic completion: >
     :MUcompleteAutoOff
<
   and try to complete a word using the corresponding mapping (see
   |ins-completion| for a list of available mappings). For example,
   for omni completion, use |i_ctrl-x_ctrl-o|. Do you get
   a different output compared to what µcomplete provides? If not,
   then the problem is not µcomplete.

   If triggering completion manually results in the expected
   behaviour, but µcomplete behaves differently, open an issue on
   GitHub.
